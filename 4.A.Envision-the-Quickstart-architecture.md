<h3><b><u>A. Envision the Quickstart architecture</u></b></h3> 
First step towards building a good Quickstart would be to draw the overall low-level architecture of the solution. You should start
developing template once this architecture design is finalized. Architecture design should contain overall solution components such
as Virtual Network, Subnetâ€™s, Storage accounts, Virtual Machines, App Service etc. Sample architecture diagram can be found here.
