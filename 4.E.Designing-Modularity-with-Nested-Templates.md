<h3><b><u>E. Designing Modularity with Nested Templates</u></b></h3>
To deploy your solution, you can use either a single template or a main template with multiple nested templates. Nested templates are
common for more advanced scenarios. Nested templates contain the following advantages:<br/>

•	Provides benefits in terms of testing, reuse, and readability.<br/>
•	Can reuse nested templates with other main templates of different quickstart solutions.<br/>

When you decide to decompose your template design into multiple nested templates, the following guidelines helps in standardize the design.
The recommended design consists of the following templates:<br/>
•	<b>Main template</b> (azuredeploy.json): Used for the input parameters.<br/>
•	<b>Shared resources template</b>: Deploys the shared resources that all other resources use (for example, virtual network, availability 
sets). The expression <b>dependsOn</b> enforces that this template is deployed before the other templates.<br/>
•	<b>Optional resources template</b>: Conditionally deploys resources based on a parameter (for example, a jumpbox).<br/>
•	<b>Member resources templates</b>: Each instance type within an application tier has its own configuration. Within a tier, different
instance types can be defined (such as, first instance creates a cluster, additional instances are added to the existing cluster). Each 
instance type has its own deployment template.<br/>
•	<b>Scripts</b>: Widely reusable scripts are applicable for each instance type (for example, initialize and format additional disks).
Custom scripts are created for specific customization purpose are different per instance type.<br/>
