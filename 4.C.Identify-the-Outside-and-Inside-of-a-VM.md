<h3><b><u>C. Identify the Outside and Inside of a VM</u></b></h3>
As you design your template, it’s helpful to look at the requirements in terms of what’s outside and inside of the virtual machines (VMs):<br/> 
•	Outside means the VMs and other resources of your deployment, such as the network topology, tagging, references to the certs/secrets, 
and role-based access control. All are part of your ARM template.<br/>
•	For the VM’s insides—that is, the installed software and overall desired state configuration—other mechanisms are used in whole or in 
part, such as VM extensions or scripts. These may be identified and executed by the template but aren’t in it.<br/> 
Common examples of activities you would do “inside the box” include<br/> 
•	Install or remove server roles and features<br/> 
•	Install and configure software at the node or cluster level<br/> 
•	Deploy websites on a web server<br/> 
•	Deploy database schemas<br/> 
•	Manage registry or other types of configuration settings<br/> 
•	Manage files and directories<br/> 
•	Start, stop, and manage processes and services<br/> 
•	Manage local groups and user accounts<br/> 
•	Install and manage packages (.msi, .exe, yum, etc.)<br/> 
•	Manage environment variables<br/> 
•	Run native scripts (Windows PowerShell, bash, etc.)<br/> 

Typically, you will use one or more VM extension to achieve automatic provisioning of inside VM components. Most widely used VM Extension will include<br/> 
•	Desired State Configuration (DSC)<br/> 
•	Custom Script Extension (For both Windows and Linux VM’s)<br/> 
•	Other 3rd part VM Extension such as Chef/Puppet etc.<br/> 

Defining inside and outside VM things will help you in designing the solution template effectivity.
