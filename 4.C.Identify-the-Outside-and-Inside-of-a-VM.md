<h3><b><u>C. Identify the Outside and Inside of a VM</u></b></h3>
As you design your template, it’s helpful to look at the requirements in terms of what’s outside and inside of the virtual machines (VMs):<br/> 
•	Outside means the VMs and other resources of your deployment, such as the network topology, tagging, references to the certs/secrets, 
and role-based access control. All are part of your ARM template.<br/>
•	For the VM’s insides—that is, the installed software and overall desired state configuration—other mechanisms are used in whole or in 
part, such as VM extensions or scripts. These may be identified and executed by the template but aren’t in it.
